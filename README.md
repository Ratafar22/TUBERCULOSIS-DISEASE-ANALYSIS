# TUBERCULOSIS-DISEASE-ANALYSIS
I carried out this project to analyse the spread of tuberculosis disease among the WHO countries from 2000 to 2020. I wanted to check for the countries with the highest TB cases, the number of HIV patients affected by this disease, the percentage of the population affected, and to check for the mortality rate among those affected.

Insights from this report will enable the stakeholders to know which countries or regions need more intervention in stopping the spread of TB and to be able to declare the World TB free by eradicating the disease.
